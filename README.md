# PIGEON EMAIL - CS50x Final Project
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/gJU2xEQmU-c
## Explaining the project
My final project is an Email website that allows users to send, receive and manage emails.
The project is based on a pyhton framework "Flask" combined with SQLite, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap to make it more aesthetic and Interactive.
All information about users, emails are stored in project.db.
I used CS50.SQL extension to connect the database to application and sqlite3 to manager it.

## Features

- [Flask Web Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [CS50 Library](https://github.com/cs50/libcs50)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [HTML](https://html.com/)
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

I've used Flask web framework python-based with Sqlite Manage SQL databases,
i used cs50.SQL object to configure CS50 Library to use SQLite database engine.
and of course i used python to build up the flask app besides HTML, CSS and Bootsrap to make the webpage more aesthetic, and with JavaScript to make it more interactive.

### Database:
I needed two tables for my database:

- First, table users. Which stores id as a primary key, username(Email) and hash (for password).

- Second, table emails. Which stores id as a primary key, sender, recipient, subject, body and timestamp.

### Routing

Each route checks if the user is authenticated. It means if correct mail and password were supplied. So for example a user cannot enter /compose route without registering or logging in.

### Sessions

The webpage uses sessions to confirm that user is registered. Once the user logins, his credentials are checked. Once everything passes a session is created (serialized and deserialized) and stored in the cookies. The server attaches user to subsequent requests, so the back-end can easily access the details, like emails details: sender, recipient, etc.

### Database

Database stores all users, emails. The tables, like emails uses foreign keys to relate users to emails.
For example, emails use username in users table as a foriegn key to relate an email to its sender or its recipient.
```python
@app.route("/sent")
@login_required
def sent():
    """Show Sent Emails"""
    userID = session["user_id"]
    usernameDB = db.execute("SELECT username FROM users WHERE id = ?", userID)
    username = usernameDB[0]["username"]
    emails = db.execute("SELECT * FROM emails WHERE sender = ?", username)
    return render_template("sent.html", emails=emails)
```

Validations for regesterition:
``` python
@app.route("/register", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def register():
    """Register user"""
    if request.method == "GET":
        return render_template("register.html")
    else:
        email = request.form.get("username")
        password = request.form.get("password")
        confirm = request.form.get("confirm")

        if not email or not password or not confirm :
            return apology("No Empty Fields !")

        if password != confirm :
            return apology("Password Do Not Match !")

        hash = generate_password_hash(password)

        try:
            #INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
            newUser = db.execute("INSERT INTO users (username, hash) VALUES (? ,?)", email, hash)
        except:
            return apology("Email Already Used !")
```
## Animations and Aesthetics
the Webpage includes Floating placeholder implemented by bootstrap's floating placeholder by adding in Register, Login Routes.
``` HTML
<div class="form-floating mb-3" style="width:250px; margin:auto;">
            <input type="email" class="form-control" id="floatingInput" name="username" placeholder="name@example.com">
            <label for="floatingInput">Email Address</label>
        </div>
        <div class="form-floating mb-3" style="width:250px; margin:auto;">
            <input class="form-control" id="floatingInput" name="password" placeholder="Password" type="password">
            <label for="floatingInput">Password</label>
        </div>
```

I have implemented animated colorful border in composing, replying forms using CSS animation attribute with hue-rotate() function.
``` CSS
.anim-frame
{
    background: linear-gradient(to right, var(--cores-dancantes));
    border-radius: 10px;
    position: relative;
    z-index: 999;
    animation: coresDancantes 2s linear infinite;

}
@keyframes coresDancantes {
    100% {
        filter: hue-rotate(360deg);
    }
}
```
## Interactivity
the webpage have a show password checkbox when logging in or registering, and it was implemented by JavaScript combined with CSS type attribute.

``` JavaScript
document.querySelector("#show-password").addEventListener("input", function() {
            document.querySelector('[name="password"]').type = this.checked ? "text" : "password";
            document.querySelector('[name="confirm"]').type = this.checked ? "text" : "password";
          });
```
the webpage also shows a message "No Received Emails Yet!" or "No Sent Emails Yet!" if there's no emails was loaded from the database, and this was implemented using JavaScript if condition statment.
```javascript
var x = document.getElementById("no_email");
        if(document.querySelectorAll('.email').length > 0){
            x.style.display = "none";
        }
```
I added a dynamic counter for emails, which is shown in inbox and sent routes by using CSS section counter by adding id = "counter" in the wanted element tag.
``` CSS
tbody
{
    counter-reset: section;
}
#counter::before
{
    counter-increment: section;
    content: counter(section);
}
```
